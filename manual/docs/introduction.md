Blizzard 4 is a 16-bit computer designed to be implemented with basic 7400-series integrated circuits. This app contains a cycle-accurate emulator, demo programs and a software toolchain so that you develop programs yourself.

<br>

### Getting Started
To run a demo program, click the **menu button ( &#9776; )** in the top left corner and click **Demo Programs**.

You can choose from a variety of games, computer self-tests and other applications. The source code can be viewed with the "View Source" button. Alternatively, you can click "Run" to jump straight into the emulator with the chosen program.
